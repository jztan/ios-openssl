This branch forked from https://github.com/st3fan/ios-openssl

This script builds OpenSSL 0.9.8y for iOS.

It builds multi-architecture libaries with support for armv7, armv7s (iPhone 5),
arm64 (iPhone 5S, iPad Air and iPad Mini Retina) and also for 32 and 64-bit
Intel targets for running in the simulator.

This script is known to work with the following combination of software versions:

 * MacOS X 10.9
 * XCode 5.0.2 & iOS SDK 7.0

The compiled libraries should be downward compatible to iOS 4.3 at least.

Building is done by invoking the build.sh script:

 ./build.sh

The result of the build can be found at:

 lib/ - will contain libssl.a and libcrypto.a
 include/ - will contain all OpenSSL headers

If you just want cryptographic functions then you can skip libssl.a and just add
libcrypto.a to your project.

Making your code find the OpenSSL headers works best if the path to the include director is
added to the 'Header Search Paths' in your target settings.

The Example directory contains a little sample app. It calculates a SHA1 digest using
the OpenSSL API.
